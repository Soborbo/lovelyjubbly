          Not every move needs a full removal crew. Man and van services offer a practical, cost-effective option for smaller jobs where you need professional help without the full removal package.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is a Man and Van Service?</h2>
        <p>
          Man and van combines a professional driver with a suitable vehicle for moving your items. Unlike full removal services, you typically help with loading and might do your own packing. It's the middle ground between hiring a van yourself and booking a complete removal team. You get experience and proper equipment at a fraction of the cost.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Ideal For</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Small moves:</strong> Studio flats, single rooms, or moving a few pieces of furniture</li>
          <li><strong>Single items:</strong> Bought a sofa online? Need a wardrobe delivered? Man and van handles one-off items</li>
          <li><strong>Student moves:</strong> End of term clear-outs or moving into new digs</li>
          <li><strong>eBay and marketplace collections:</strong> Collecting purchases that won't fit in your car</li>
          <li><strong>Office furniture:</strong> Moving desks, chairs, or equipment between locations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What's Included</h2>
        <p>
          A standard man and van service includes the driver's time, fuel costs, and use of the vehicle. Most operators carry basic moving equipment like trolleys, straps, and blankets. Goods-in-transit insurance protects your items during the move. Some services offer additional helpers at extra cost if you need more hands for heavier items.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Pricing Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Man and van services typically charge by the hour, with a minimum booking period (usually two hours). Rates vary based on van size and the number of helpers. Some operators offer fixed prices for specific routes or job types. Getting a few quotes helps you compare options and find the best value for your particular move.
