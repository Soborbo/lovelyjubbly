          Whether you're between homes, decluttering, or need extra space for your business, self storage provides a flexible solution that works around your needs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Types of Storage</h2>
        <p>
          Storage facilities cater to diverse needs. Domestic customers often store furniture during renovations, seasonal items, or belongings during a house move. Business storage suits companies needing space for stock, equipment, or archived documents. Student storage offers term-time solutions for university students who need somewhere safe for their belongings during holidays.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Security Features</h2>
        <p>
          Modern storage facilities prioritise security with multiple layers of protection. Expect 24-hour CCTV monitoring, individual unit alarms, secure access codes, and well-lit premises. Many facilities have on-site staff during business hours and robust perimeter fencing. Your belongings are protected by comprehensive insurance options for complete peace of mind.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Flexible Terms</h2>
        <p>
          Self storage adapts to your timeline. Most facilities offer contracts from as little as one week, with the flexibility to extend as needed. There are typically no long-term commitments required, and you can often upgrade or downgrade your unit size as your storage needs change. Access hours vary — many offer extended or even 24/7 access.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Choosing the Right Unit Size</h2>
        <p>
          Selecting the right unit prevents paying for space you don't need while ensuring everything fits. A small locker suits documents and small items. A unit equivalent to a garden shed stores furniture from a small flat. Larger units accommodate entire house contents. Storage consultants can help estimate your requirements based on an inventory of what you're storing.
